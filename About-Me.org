Hi! I'm Tom, a he/him/his guy who likes to play with computers, cook, and play games with his family. This is my mostly tech blog where I share some of the cool stuff that I figure out.

Or as George Burns liked to say "I love to sing, and I love to drink scotch. Most people would rather hear me drink scotch." I love to write about what I learn when I play with computers 🙂, and this blog gives me an outlet for doing so.

Here's where you can find me:
