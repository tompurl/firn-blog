#+TITLE: Fun With KDE Neon

* tl;dr

[[https://neon.kde.org/][KDE Neon]] is a fantastic, desktop-oriented Linux distribution. It is snappy, cohesive, and incredibly simple to install and configure for many purposes. Any user of KDE that wants something up-to-date that "just works" should consider it.

* The Whys

For the last year or so I've been using [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] on my personal laptop. It is an excellent, well-designed Linux distribution that is powered by the Nix package manager. I would tell you why this technology is so cool but I think [[https://nixos.org/explore.html][this page]] does a better job than I would.

I, however, had the following issues running it on my personal laptop:

- *Less than stellar multimedia support*: I spent hours trying to get Jack audion working, all to no avail for example.
- *Difficulty with containers*: You have to use special workarounds to use technologies like Snaps, Docker, AppImage, and Flatpak. Often, these workarounds required more knowledge of derivations and the entire Nix ecosystem than I possessed, and I have trouble finding enough time to learn what was necessary.
- *Many desktop app packages were broken*: Bitwarden is a good example. There's an official package (actually, they're called derivations with Nix) but it doesn't work, even after spending quite a bit of time troubleshooting.

*Note*: This is /not/ a NixOS diss track üò∫ NixOS is excellent for many uses and I still happily use the Nix Package Manager every day on other Linux distributions. It just wasn't ideal for this use case.

So I needed something new that worked for *everything I wanted to do*, was *stupid-simple to setup*, and had *good support for KDE*. And that's why I tried *KDE Neon*.

* What is it?

Here's the description from the project home:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE -r
The latest and greatest of KDE community software packaged on a rock-solid base.
#+END_QUOTE

This translates into the following stack:

1. Ubuntu 20.04
2. A "Neon" PPA that provides the latest and greatest KDE binaries

So if you're familiar with the Ubuntu ecosystem you should be comfortable.

* Laptop Info

I use an *IBM Thinkpad T490*. it is light, has a very long battery life, is very durable and reasonably priced. However, it's not very powerful, but that's ok. If I need to run anything that requires more oomph then I run it on a remote server.

Here's the "about this system" info:

* First impressions

** Very Simple Setup

I think I clicked on about 4 or 5 buttons to install the OS. It was trivially simple. When it was done everything below was properly configured:

- Wifi
- My graphics card

This may sound trivial but on a lot of distributions can make setting up these services cumbersome at best. i /still/ don't think that I properly configured my graphics card on my old system.

** Package Management is Weird but Manageable

I'm a big fan of Debian's package manager =apt=, which is *one* of the package mangers that this system uses. After the initial installation I tried upgrading things and got an interesting message:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
On KDE neon you should use `pkcon update` to install updates.
If you absolutely must use apt you do have to use dist-upgrade or full-upgrade in place of the upgrade command.
  https://neon.kde.org/faq#command-to-update
Abort.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Uhhhh, ok. I've never heard of [[https://packagekit.freedesktop.org/][PackageKit]] before it appears to be yet another attempt at unifying all existing, Liunx-based package managers while also /extending/ those managers (which is the scary part to me).

There's also a graphical package manager called [[https://apps.kde.org/discover/][Discover]] which also wraps =apt= *and* makes it easy to install [[https://www.flatpak.org/][Flatpaks]]. I haven't used it to install any apps yet but I /have/ used it to *update the firmware on my laptop*, which is something I've never seen a package manager recommend before. So that's actually quite nice.

I do need to use a few [[https://snapcraft.io/about][Snaps]] and so far those have worked perfectly.
** The KDE Integration is Flawless üëÄ üç¨

(My current desktop using the [[https://apps.kde.org/latte-dock/][Latte dock]] and the [[https://store.kde.org/p/1399346/][mcOS-Big-Sur-large]] layout.)

I really like using KDE but in the past I've had the following issues:

- My distribution shipped a fairly old version
- I was unable to install add-ons or themes

Both of these issues have eliminated with KDE Neon.I'm using the latest stable version of KDE and I have been able to effortlessly install lots of fun eye candy.

** Performance and Snappiness is Good

Like I said above my laptop is not exactly a speed demon. Thankfully I haven't had any performance issues or lockups yet. Everything feels *very fast and responsive*.
