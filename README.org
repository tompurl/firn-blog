#+title: README

If you're reading this, then you're probably reading the source code for my blog on Github. If not, then you visited this page on [[https://blog.tompurl.com][my blog]]. Either way, congratulations! This is a /very/ good use of your time ðŸ˜‰

My blog is maintained and built using the following excellent tools:

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]
- [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]
- [[https://github.com/theiceshelf/firn][firn]] - By far my favorite static site generating tool ever. May it live a long life.
